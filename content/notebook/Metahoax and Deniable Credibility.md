What constitutes proof of UFOs, UAP, extraterrestrials?  The proof that is released through the US government is often muddy, often paradoxical.  On one hand David Fravor's testimony is very believable in an intuitive, empathetic sense.  But the Gimbal footage isn't spectacular in anyway.  And it can easily be written off as lens artefacts, at least at a casual glance, and possibly even when subjected to deeper analysis.  There is something there for both audiences - the skeptics and the believers.  And you can sit in either camp, look at the same evidence and argue happily.

Compare that to the night-vision, triangle bokeh video.  That is clearly triangular bokeh.  No doubt about it.  Is there a UFO there?  Well only if it is flashing its lights at in the same pattern as aircraft navigation lights, and then it is filmed through lensing resulting in  triangular, green bokeh.  

What is interesting in both of these cases is both perspectives are reasonable, and could even be simultaneously correct.  Gimbal could be a UFO/UAP and could also show artefacts from mechanical optics.  The night vision triangle UFO/UAP could have been a UFO intentionally mimicking aircraft navigation lights and also exhibit lens artefacts.  

This is a pattern that is common across UFO evidence, especially evidence from official sources, at various levels of arms-lengthness.  And viewing evidence through this lens, we can learn not only about the things that might be true in the evidence, we can also learn about the intentions of those releasing this evidence in order to stir up confusion, feeding meet to the skeptics, and kale to the believers.  It also raises questions of context.  Analytical or intuitive.  Left brain or right brain.  Science or faith.  

I find the following video fascinating in an intuitive, felt way.  As someone who works with media art, music, timing, aesthetics.  There are some aspects of this video that are just so, so, sooo hard to achieve.  It's not that one can't do it, but some of the skills required are excellent acting, directing, and extremely high levels of creative energy.  These skills have a very high ceiling, and when you see highly accomplished work it has a wow-factor.

In this video, the parts that grab my attention are 
1.) the timing and delivery of the reaction "wow" at the end of the video. That shit is genuine.  Either that, or the film students who created this are phenomenal actors.  Good for them.  

2.) The pattern the UFO makes in the sky.  It appears as interlinking, red lights, that rotate around a central axis and seem to drift in some sort of harmonic phasing relationship.  Real or fake - in either case - it is amazing.  If I had a student who presented this video to me as a project to assess,  I would specifically note the incredible detail in the animation of the red lights.    I do not often see that sort of creative brilliance from students.  It's real damn good work, even if it is compressed to hell.

```
thoughts on the pattern in the phasing red lights - likely made up rotating+translating at different ratios of time, in some consonant arrangement.  Very John Whitneyesque - it is *musical*.

I also see this sort of "demonstration of awe" in the UAP video with the orbs doing the dance.  Again - parts acting as a one. Music. Beauty. Awe.  Time phasing crops up in descriptions of entities movement in : [The Ariel Encounter](The%20Ariel%20Encounter.md)

A huffy, debunking perspective on the Jerusalem videos ðŸ‘‰ https://www.livescience.com/12826-jerusalem-ufo-hoax.html 

Multiple angles, multiple videos, some clearly fake.  Skeptics decry implausibility and point to evidence of tampering. The murkiness emerges!  

There is a give away that the most impressive of the angles has been digitally manipulated.  There are some mirrored, moving pixels, in the bottom and left of the video.  The video has clearly gone through some sort of tracking and stabilisation process.  

So where is the conflict in these perspectives?  We have digital artefacts that show it is doctored (thank you left brain), we have intuitions that suggest there is something very artistically accomplished.  The work of world class hoaxers?  Yes.

Another non-responsive web presence, and non-active youtube channel is IvanXXX.  A channel that hosts the famous skinny bob video.

Let's start from ironed, short-sleeved, debunking perspective.  This video very much seems to use a post-processing, old-timey camera effect, with audio to boot.  I believe people have tracked down the exact plugin used and to me it seems quite evident from casual inspection.

Detailed analysis has been done and revealed many layers of video overlays. So from a debunking perspective we would call it a slam dunk.

Let's another perspective - what is so compelling about this video?  I'd suggest it is the fact the alien depicted is on the other side of the uncanny valley (thank you right brain).  If this is puppetry, stop-motion, or CGI, the alien being in this video is remarkable work....  remarkable work that is then post-processed to show it is obviously fake.

If you have the worlds best animatronics, stop-motion, or CGI artists creating this beautiful puppet, why not go to the effort of reprojecting with a real, analog, film projector.  It's not like you are lacking in resources if you are creating work of this calibre.

We expect the dissonance to be is it real or fake?  But we can see both of these perspectives have their justifications.  The mismatch is really why someone would go to so much effort to create a convincing fake, only to fall at the last hurdle.  Metahoaxters!

It's worth noting, this sort of metahoax would be a very smart strategy if you wanted to release evidence of unfamiliar, advanced life without causing panic.  You would need to soften the blow by giving skeptics something to sink their teeth into, and not let anything to be too credible.  A controlled shit-show.

Other examples might be the press club disclosure event, with a mix of people testifying, some credible, some not.  In a fuzzy mix of confusion you have senior military officials describing UFO's taking over nuclear weapons facilities, at an event introduced by an overly confident man who inappropriately burst out into song right at the start.  A shit-show.

The inability to pause on a single frame of a very unimpressive video of a UAP during the recent hearing.  A general shit-show.

Bob Lazaar's general controversy.  A bit of a shit-show.

If we resist the urge to come to any final conclusion, from this perspective we can see a mish-mash of disturbing and credible reports,  manipulated and murky documented evidence, and a clear pattern of a massive fucking shit-show.  This shit-show does seem to have a trajectory, however, and it seems to be steering us towards are weirder and more confusing future than most of us were expecting.

Metafraudsters.
Injecting deniable credibility 
into underwater internet-tubes.

We cracked the case. 

Thanks everyone,
we can all go home now.

More notes...

Another video on a channel similar to the two above with a single, convincing video, and little other activity except some personal videos from a nice looking, and seemingly accomplished nerd.  Well done to them.

Another channel "ladave1969" removed or delisted the more convincing video of a few cgi videos, and continues the convention of a generic username and seemingly abandoned youtube channel.

The channel of the animator  has some debunking cgi demonstrations.  Their artsy, animated confession is very explicitly meta as you would expect from someone putting so much effort into out-thinking the world. http://www.hoaxart.com
