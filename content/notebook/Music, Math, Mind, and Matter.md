We can consider music as  a [perception of unity](Musical%20Qualia%20as%20the%20Perception%20of%20Unity.md)

More precisely - qualia that emerges from the perception of parts acting as a whole.

This perspective broadens considerably what might constitute musical experience beyond the sonic, to include visual or kinesthetic modes of artistic expression.

This could infact point to an underlying root aesthetic sense - that of temporal relationships of parts.  Mass choreography, visual music, murmations, various phenomenon could elicit this aesthetic sense.

The evolution of music has often seemed perplexing, resisting explanation.  This seeming resistance could provide us a clue that perhaps we are asking the wrongs question - perhaps we should reassess our assumptions.

Parallel and related, the evolution of consciousness itself seems to resist explanation.  Chalmers Meta question of consciousness may hold a clue. 

Rather than asking how consciousness emerges from the brain, perhaps we should ask *does* consciousness emerge from the brain?

And if we do take the brave step of reframing consciousness as something more fundamental, how might this reframe how we think of other perplexing mental phenomenon.  If music didn't evolve in response to our environment, perhaps it is rather a facet of consciousness that the material world has risen to meet.  Somewhat like mathematics.  Did we invent mathematics, or did we discover it?  Does it exist absent of mind?


Interestingly, music is something that breaks our often rigid demarcation of what is subjective and what is objective.  

It is reasonable to assume that two individuals with the same listening history and the same biology would experience the same qualia given a musical stimulus.  The statistical model in their memory would be the same, leading to the same dynamic, schematic, and veridical memory, interacting with the same biological matter.  Variations in either biology or listening history will lead to differences in subjective experience.  There is an objective stimulus leading to subjective qualia - that potential subjective qualia varies infinitely, yet coalesces around a point in a sort of phase-space, to use a term favoured by John David Ebert.
