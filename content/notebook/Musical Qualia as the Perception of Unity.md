## What is musical?

When we listen to music, most often, we are listening to individual performers playing as "a whole".  

We can then interrogate some of the dichotomies in music - for example that of consonance and dissonance. If consonance is a perception of players playing "harmoniously" together, dissonance is negation of that.  So dissonance can be perceived as "less musical".  Although perhaps it is precisely this divergence from that which is most "musical" which provides a vantage point from which we can more fully appreciate consonance.  Notice that dissonance is a spectrum, and we tend to prefer the dissonance that is with in view of consonance.  Very few of us consider white noise to be musical.

This perception of unity, the perception of parts acting as a whole, does not restric our musical sense to sound.  And indeed, if we look at the work of visual music pioneer John Whitney, what do we see?  Parts acting as a whole.

Mystical states defined as a sense of unity, or a dissolution of dichotomy (Barrett and Griffiths, 2017)

Non-dual experiences involve a relaxation of the typical subject-object (self vs. other, internal vs. external, good vs. bad, us vs. them, etc) perspective that pervades typical waking consciousness (Josipovic, 2014) ðŸ‘ˆ from Barret et al 2017- Qualitative and Quantitative Features of Music Reported to Support Peak Mystical Experiences during Psychedelic Therapy Sessions

## What makes music psychedelic?

Again from Barret et al 2017
Qualitative analysis (expert rating of musical and music-theoretic features of the recommended stimuli) and quantitative analysis (using signal processing and music-information retrieval methods) of 22 of these stimuli yielded a description of peak period music that was characterised by regular, predictable, formulaic phrase structure and orchestration, a feeling of continuous movement and forward motion that slowly builds over time, and lower perceptual brightness when compared to pre peak music. These results provide a description of music that may be optimally supportive of peak psychedelic experiences.

Interestingly, this description: 

```

```

... which is in strong contrast to genres which purport to be "psychedelic".  Cardiacs, King Gizzard, Zappa, later Beatles etc etc.

What could be happening here?  Psychedelic music is often considered to be dense, atypical, demanding on the listener, and perhaps most of all, surprising... though perhaps not. Pink Floyd, Tool etc could be labelled by some as psychedelic, and although they contain some complexities, there is also a great deal of repetition.  Tool, for example, make extensive use of polymeter yet their music remains tonally consistant.  This could be considered an example of [[Anchoring]].
