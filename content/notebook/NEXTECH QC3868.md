The NEXTECH QC3863 ([available here](https://www.jaycar.com.au/miniature-1080p-wifi-ip-camera-with-rechargeable-battery-and-ir-leds-for-night-vision/p/QC3863)) is a small, battery powered, IP security camera, capable of recording to an internal SD card and being administrated via a mobile app.  Streaming video is able to be accessed via local network, though it is poorly documented.  This thing is insecure as shit.  Keep it off the internet and untrusted networks as much as possible.

#### Steps to access local streaming video
- Use Tuya Smart iOS app to connect camera to wifi
- you can disable the timestamp while you are in here
- Find or set cameras IP address

You can then access the following:
(my camera IP was set to 192.168.1.120)

- A (very basic) web interface:

[http://192.168.1.120:9527/index.htm](http://192.168.1.120:9527/index.htm)

- Two high resolution H264 streams, high latency (1000ms +)

[rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.1.120:6554/stream_1](rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.1.120:6554/stream_1)

- A MJPG ( i think?) stream.  640x360, low latency (approx 300ms)

- Single JPG frames, similar to above

RTSP in TouchDesigner could be a bit of a game changer in cases where latency isn't critical.


The camera's IR sensitivity interferes with colours. It's not a faithful representation but has a good vibe when giving you colour.

Camera battery arrived very flat.  

On boot the camera created an open network.  Windows did not easily connect.  Instead, I used a (very polished) 3rd party app called **Tuya Smart**.

- 游녨 Camera is capable of simultaneous charging and operating
- 游녨 Camera connected easily  
- 游녨 Video quality is good
- 游녩 Latency is high on default camera settings and  my medium strength network

Tuya Smart turns out to be better suited to home automation than camera configuration.

Camera presented open network on reboot and iOS connected successfully.
Network information reports router @ **192.168.66.1**
Phone has been given  **192.168.66.100**
Subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

Trying to connect to router via browser returns ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED 

The device has remembered the network and reconnects on boot.

I can ping the camera.

Using the BlueCAM search tool from the www.bluecam.cloud found in the spec sheet, I was able to see this:

The firefox stream viewer looks 720p.  Lacenty is good.  Deals with low light well.

No instantly apparent configuration settings for joining WiFi.
Would ideally like to join WiFi without broadcasting a stream to a third party.

This link gets us the image directly in browser, although defaulted to 640x360

Returning to Tuya Smart to connect camera to local network.
Pairing light goes solid after viewing QR code.
Gave the camera a static local ip in router and rebooted camera.
Camera reconnected with reserved ip.

Progress.

And we have the full res stream in VLC!

[rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.1.120:6554/stream_1](rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.1.120:6554/stream_1)

Both streams have significant latency.  The stream shown in the browser is very snappy, however.  I suspect this is mjpg as that was mentioned in the spec sheet.

From the served admin page - the firefox link is making the call:
```
javascript:signin_serverpush()
```

Poking around further in the website served by the camera, the Wifi SSID and password are there in plain text.  Not great security.  It would be wise to assume anything these cameras see may as well be public.

The variable linda_is_sleping is pretty odd.  Searching the string does not throw anything up on google.  Nor Github.  Weird.
