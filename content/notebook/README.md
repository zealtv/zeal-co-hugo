# The open notebook of Bob Jarvis

These are my working notes as of early '22. There will be snippets of code, notes on projects, and general R&D.  

⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is not currently polished up for public consumption. There *will* be spelling errors.  [Alot of errors](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html). Information will move around, change, or disappear. This notebook is backed up as a [Github repo](https://github.com/zealtv/notebook) which will hold a history of changes. Improvements will be made with time.

⭐⭐⭐⭐
