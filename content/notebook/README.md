# The open notebook of Bob Jarvis

⭐⭐⭐⭐

These notes are not written for public consumption.  This is a scratchpad for text mostly for my convienience. There [Alot of errors](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html)  and bad formatting. Information will move around, change, or disappear. This notebook and the encapsulating website is backed up as a [Github repo](https://github.com/zealtv/zeal-co-hugo) which will hold a history of changes.
