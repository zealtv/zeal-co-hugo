We're going to look at using RNBO to export a plugin we can use in our other tools.  RNBO patches can be exported as VST3 for Windows, OSX, and Linux, covering the vast majority of tools and operating systems ( and RNBO's JavaScript export can help us target those pesky mobile devices ). 

We will look at exporting both effects and instruments as VST3 plugins.

We'll then look at them running an an assortment of hosts.  You should experiment with opening them in the weirdest VST3 or AU compatible host you use.
