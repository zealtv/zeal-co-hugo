abstract: "Belief System is a large-scale, multi-channel audio installation built upon an ever-growing collection of thousands of audio recording of statements of belief.  Each of the thousands of beliefs is curated into a thematic flock and programmed to both whisper from the speakers and flow above and around the listener."

Belief System is a scalable work suited to site specific interiors as well as black and white boxes.  For presentation existing content is replaced or augmented with local content (including multilingual content} and visitors to the installation can also share their Beliefs to become part of the system.
