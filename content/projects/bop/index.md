## what the bop? 🦜 
bop is a suite of music-making abstractions for the media programming environment [pure data](puredata.info/).  it is designed to be flexible, user-friendly, and fun.  it could be run on old hardware, embedded into gadgets, or be deployed at massive scale in distributed, immersive installations.

```
git clone https://github.com/zealtv/bop --recursive
```

## origins
**bop** came out of my [PhD research](/projects/aileron-one) and saw [many iterations](/projects/elevon-one).  It was developed to address some unmet needs I came across working with embeded dynamic music systems and [large-scale wifi-controlled speaker arrays](/projects/belief-system). It's currently deployed in [The Plants](https://www.playablestreets.com/the-plants) by [Playable Streets](https://www.playablestreets.com/).

You can download and play with bop [here](https://github.com/zealtv/bop).
