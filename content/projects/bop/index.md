**bop** came out of my [PhD research](/projects/aileron-one) and saw [many iterations](/projects/elevon-one).  It was developed to address some unmet needs I came across working with embeded dynamic music systems and [large-scale wifi-controlled speaker arrays](/projects/belief-system). It's currently deployed in [The Plants](https://www.playablestreets.com/the-plants) by [Playable Streets](https://www.playablestreets.com/).

You can download and play with bop [here](https://github.com/zealtv/bop).
