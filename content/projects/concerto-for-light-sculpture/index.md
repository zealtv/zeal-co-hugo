This piece won the Vice Chancellors Award at The International Space Time Concerto Competition in 2012. Fun fact: the macbook used in the performance was limping along with a faulty logic board and died shortly after.

The concepts explored in the piece were continued and refined in my collaboration with [Gian Slater](http://gianslater.com/), [Luminesce](http://zeal.co/project/luminesce/).
