I provided software to interface Ableton Live with a pipe organ built for Johnny Walker. The organ was unveiled at [Symphony in Blue](http://bompasandparr.com/projects/view/symphony-in-blue/), an immersive theatrical experience put together by [Bompas and Parr](http://bompasandparr.com/). The software was branched and customized from plugins developed for interfacing with The Melbourne Town Hall Grand Organ in 2013.
