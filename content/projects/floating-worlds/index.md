Floating Worlds was an interactive piece for children by Melbourne artist [Justin Dwyer](http://justindwyer.com/). I provided a kinetic projection mapping system that allowed recordings of children to be projected onto moving, smoke filled bubbles, tracked by a kinect. The project used TouchDesigner for tracking and projection.

Floating Worlds was nominated for for the 2015 [Lumen Prize](http://lumenprize.com/artwork/floating-worlds).
