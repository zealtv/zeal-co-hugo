Luminesce is a collaboration between myself and [Gian Slater's](http://gianslater.com/) [Invenio](http://gianslater.com/invenio-singers/).  It was first performed over two nights in July, 2013 at The Guild Theatre, Melbourne. Further iterations went on to win [The International Visual Music Award](http://www.visual-music-award.de/en) in 2015 and then to become featured at White Night 2016 with a four hour performance at St Pauls Cathedral.
