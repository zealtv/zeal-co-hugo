Eighteen Flowers a visual music piece exploring synchresis and musical arrangement.  It utilises hand-animated pixel art, slit-screen reanimation, and generative sequencing. 

The flowers are drawn and animated in Aseprite and reanimated in Max, where each acts as a synthesizer voice.  The height of the flower is directly linked to the amplitude of the oscilators. The pitches are chosen to alternately voice a IV^#11 and VIm9 chords.

I'm very happy with the outcome of this short piece - for me, it induces a pause - a welcome contrast to the hyperactivty of NFT Twitter.
