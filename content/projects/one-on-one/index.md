```
Picture of Bob being teachy and professional.
```

```
Amongst my varied creative output exist touchscreen games for orangutans, and a full-sized glider turned flying musical instrument. It's been a wacky time. I offer my accumulated knowledge and experience to help you uncover novel or efficient means to your own creative ends.
