# FAQ
#### What services are used to facilitate the service?
 Calendly for scheduling and intake form, Paypal for payment, Zoom for one-on-sessions.


#### Can I have more than one session?
Sessions can be reoccurring or one-offs.  

For in-depth learning it can be effectiveto structure a progression of about six sessions through out the duration of a project.  This can be something you are already working on, or I can help you devise something to suit your goals.

One-off sessions can be useful at the planning stages of a project.
