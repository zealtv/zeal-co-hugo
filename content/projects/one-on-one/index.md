<!-- # FAQ

#### How many sessions can I do?
🍪 Sessions can be reoccurring, one-off,  sporadic or, regular.  

🍪 For example: a short series of sessions can be structured around your current project.  

🍪 Or in a single session we can do a first-pass technical plan for your next creative work or grant proposal.


#### How is each session prepared?
You can include attachments and links to any relevant media.  Screenshots are very helpful.   -->

<!-- We often structure a progression of about six sessions across the duration of a project.  This can be a real-world project you are already working on, or I can help you devise something to suit your learning goals.

One-off sessions are offered to help point you in a productive direction, for consultation on an upcoming project, or for miscellaneous requests.  -->

<!-- #### What hardware or software do I need?
🍪 You'll at least need something to Zoom with, and internet access.   

🍪 Demo versions of most software works great for learning.  Many tools are free or cheap 🍟

#### Which 3rd parties are used?
 🍪 Calendly for scheduling and intake  
 🍪 Paypal for payment  
 🍪 Zoom for sessions -->
