Over 2020 and 2021 I found myself, like many others, displaced.  Akin to music, one change is often paired with another.  So there  I found myself, living in another state, clocking up a good number of hours on the baritone ukulele.  It is a very limited instrument that resists extended technique.  But, to paraphrase myself, limitations are the sugar-free energy drink of creativity.

After experimenting with a few different string gauges and tunings, I settled on the stock strings tuned in 4ths from a low B (B, E, A, D).  This resembles the lowest four strings of a five-string bass, in a middle-of-the-piano kind of range. It continues feed my seeming proclivity for plucked strings, struck mallets, and arpeggios.  Being such a comfortable instrument, it lends itself well to absent-minded improvisation.
