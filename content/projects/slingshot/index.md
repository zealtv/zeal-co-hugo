abstract: "Slingshot is a composition for solo baritone ukulele.  The piece is structured around a three-over-four polyrhythm.  I would situate its genre somewhere in a progressive / minimalist / folk venn diagram.  Is \"soft-prog\" a thing?  It is now."

Over 2020 and 2021 I found myself, like many others, displaced.  Akin to music, one change is often paired with another.  So there  I found myself, living in another state clocking up a good number of hours on the baritone ukulele.

It is a very limited instrument.  Even with percussive taps, and articulations, harmonics are generally weak on the nylon strings.  But, to paraphrase myself, limitations are the sugar-free energy drink of creativity.

Being such a comfortable instrument, it lends itself well to absent-minded improvisation - a kind of musical automatic writing.  Around the time of the January 6t insurrection, I captured my musical response to the news unfolding in realtime.  A recording I then titled "Duet for Baritione Ukulele and the Passing of Time"

Being a bassist, I chose the instrument due to its comfortable scale and its correct number of strings (four).  After experimenting with a few different string gauges and tunings, I settled on the stock strings tuned in 4ths from a low B (B, E, A, D).  This resembles the lowest four strings of a five-string bass, in a middle-of-the piano kind of range. It continues feed my seeming proclivity for plucked strings, struck mallets, and arpeggios.
