VIZZable2 is a suite Max for Live plugins for video manipulation and performance in Ableton Live 9.   Originally based on Maxâ€™s VIZZIE devices, VIZZable has been rebuilt from the ground up to take advantage of [gen](http://cycling74.com/products/gen/) which allows for very fast and efficient video processing on the GPU.  VIZZable is suitable for live audio visual performance, VJing, interactive installations or audio visual composition and production.  OSX users can use [syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) to route video between VIZZable and other applications.

VIZZable has a new home!
