    <p>I am working on a project that requires me to move sounds around an irregular multi-speaker array system.  The aesthetic aim is to have sounds travel through the space as if they are on the wind.</p>
<p>OSC will be used to control these virtual sound objects, and as such, the piece will be composed as streaming OSC instructions.</p>
<p>An OSC specification has been developed and I am now  investigating what tools I might use.  My first stop was touch designer which initially showed promise - it was easy to get some particles and high level realtime control going - but lacked an easy method for triggering events on the birth and death of individual particles.</p>

<a href="../ofxaddons.com">ofxaddons</a> threw up some existing particle libraries, many of the are very old and being short on time I&rsquo;m not particularly (ha!) keen on writing a system my self, forces and all.  A visual tool is a better fit.</p>

<p>Godot is appealing in as much as it is <strong>tiny</strong> but its particle tools seem immature at this point in time.  So we&rsquo;re down to the big cats - Unity or Unreal.  Both seem capable.</p>

If I am able to get Niagara spitting out OSC messages per particle, I can then leverage the complex behaviours already built into the system meaning more potential sonic expression.</p>

One hiccup may be my ageing macbook which may force either a change of software or an upgrade of hardware.</p>
<hr>
<p>After a short break - a brain wave!  Node for Max could be a good option here.  A JS particle system could be ideal.   




 





  


<a href="https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles">tsParticles</a> seems to be the clear leader - though lacks forces like wind.</p>

<p>After some experimenting in Unreal - it seems accessing the particle ID in blueprints isn&rsquo;t as straight forward as I would like.  So I returned to TouchDesigner.  I think I may found an efficient enough approach to detecting particle birth and death events via python.</p>
<hr>
<p>by the way&hellip; my ten year-old MacBook Pro&rsquo;s battery just hit this terrifying milestone:

<p>After a difficult day of programming on too little sleep, I managed to detect life events for particles in touch designer.  The approach involved creating two DATS, one storing the particles of this frame, the other storing particles of the previous frame, and comparing them in different ways to detect which particles were unique to each DAT, and which were in common.  Those in common to both a copied into an &ldquo;update DAT&rdquo;, those present this frame but not present last frame are copied into a &ldquo;born DAT&rdquo;, and those present last frame but no longer present this frame are copied into a &ldquo;kill DAT&rdquo;.</p>
