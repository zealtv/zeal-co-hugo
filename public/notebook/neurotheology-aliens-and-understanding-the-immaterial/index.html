<p>In his discussion with Jefferey Mishlove, Andy Newberg notes the importance of  &ldquo;<em>being open to all paradigms.  There is value in being reductionistic at times, and there is value in not</em>&rdquo;.  This strikes me as another example of an integral, or

<p>This kind of work 




 





  


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet">has been pursued in the past</a>, and not unexpectedly has proven controversial.  It seems extracting new the most value from these sorts of endeavours calls for a willingness to step back from ones own perspective, and a willingness to let a bigger picture come into view</p>
<p>Easier said than done when the most relevant data consists of profound, subjective experience.  It seems this kind of enquiry calls for rational dreamers, both ice-cold and open-hearted.</p>

<h2 id="another-perspective">Another perspective</h2>
<p>Iain McGilchrist describes specific relationships between areas of the brain associated with features of perceptual hallucinations - demonstrated by way of brain lesions.</p>
<p>This draws some questions from the perspective above.</p>

In his description of the perception as a whole-body phenomenon, he is echoing the picture presented by whitehead of a panexperiential universe.  Self organization leads to a concentration and intensification of experience.  Perception is streamlined to, then coodinated in our brains even more intensification.

- btw  - the missing link üêí -
McGilchrist explicitly describes the right hemisphere of the brain as being responsible for &#34;both-and&#34; thinking - an integral keyword.

Metamodernism is hot.  Destined to fail and offering so much.


McGilchrist is the first citable connection I have come across between integral conscioussness/metamodernism and a flip to panexperientialism.  I live in hope.
</code></pre><p>On one hand, brain lesions are able to create very specific hallucinations or delusions, like a familiar persons eyes being distorted, or the straight lines of houses skewed diagonally.   [[note  Oliver Sacks]]</p>
<p>On the other hand, a significant number of otherwise ordinary people describe unbelievably novel, real, surreal, and unreal experiences complete with a set of esoteric details.</p>

<p>Whether that is actually happening or not is not the question.</p>
<p>The question does is why does it seem like it is?</p>
